                        <p>This book was written based on the question "What and Why is the Philosophy of Science?". Until now, it seems that no one can stop the rapid progress of science. Recent history records science as a form of rational human thought with the results of various scientific disciplines and sub-disciplines. Accompanied by suitable methodological materials and buildings, it is well preserved in libraries or scientific institutions such as universities. The progress of science cannot be separated from every discovery that is useful for the advancement of human life. The book is perfect for a beginner who wants to study the philosophy of science and wants to know the basics of logic. Very helpful for someone who wants or will study philosophy of science. The content of the discussion that contains the history of philosophical thought to the history of methodology in modern science is beneficial for ordinary people who want to know how to develop science. By studying philosophy of science, we try to look again at a more radical and critical view of the history and development of this book.

This book contains seven chapters beginning with an introductory discussion of philosophy, several branches of science, the history of the development of philosophy, which has been packaged.

                            <h2>Paradigm of Historical Science: Dealing with the Modern Juggernaut through across Time in Education and Government</h2>
                        </a>
                        <!-- <video src="Multimedia/city-heritage-donggala-google-chrome-2024-05-16-10-54-141_vCKaoQVO.mp4" controls loop autoplay></video> -->
                        <p>In this modern era, continuous change is the first step in forming a new structure between theory and practice. The idea of â€‹a juggernaut is very relevant to the theory of structuration with current conditions in the 21st century, where technology becomes a reference that can crush anyone who is not responsive to its power. This technology takes one path and takes many roles from various fields: economic, social, political, legal, and educational. This 21st century is marked by great momentum for changes in human behavior and civilization, namely the industrial revolution 4.0 and the arrival of Covid-19, which have changed many social structures and human activities. This makes history a means of connecting the problems in the 21st century with past events. By using a descriptive qualitative method, this paper will reveal how technological developments are very influential on educational and political developments and what are the challenges faced based on historical perspective?. In this case, the study aims to discuss the history and challenges of Indonesia's education system and government system in the 21st century and give a solution. The data used are from 2 books, 14 journal articles, and 4 websites with a span of 2019-2021. The research results are expected to be used as a further study in the face of the development of the modern era in the fields of education and government. This study also has limitations, namely only on the face of the development of the modern era in the fields of education and government.</p>
